# helm-charts
A collection of Helm charts


This repo is a fork from the awesome [bjw-s](https://github.com/bjw-s/helm-charts)
## Goal

This repo contains Helm charts that I have developed to run applications in my
[home Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/PixelJonas/cluster-gitops).

This repo is not intended to be a replacement for any of the large collections
of Helm charts that are out there.

## Installation

The Helm repository can be installed as follows:

```console
helm repo add pixeljonas https://pixeljonas.github.io/helm-charts
```

You can then run `helm search repo pixeljonas` to search the charts.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](https://pixeljonas.github.io/helm-charts/docs/).
